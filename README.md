# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction & Business Insights

## 🔹 Short Description

A machine learning project that predicts customer churn and extracts actionable business insights to help subscription-based companies improve customer retention.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Customer churn leads to revenue loss in many businesses. The goal of this project is to:

* Predict whether a customer is likely to churn
* Identify the key factors influencing churn
* Convert model outputs into clear business insights

---

## 🧠 Project Workflow

* Data loading & understanding
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature encoding & scaling
* Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
* Model evaluation
* Business insight generation

---

## 📂 Dataset

* **Name:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset (IBM)
* **Source:** Kaggle
* **Records:** ~7,000 customers
* **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes / No)

Each row represents a customer using telecom services such as internet, phone, or TV subscriptions.

## 🤖 Models Used

* Logistic Regression – baseline & interpretability
* Random Forest Classifier – improved performance & feature importance

### Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision & Recall
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC-AUC Score

---

## 📈 Key Business Insights

* Month-to-month contract customers churn more frequently
* Higher monthly charges increase churn probability
* Customers with shorter tenure are at higher risk

These insights enable proactive customer retention strategies.
